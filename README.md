Hey,
so this is my first project with html and css.  Do not be mad if you see mistakes. Im going to create what is know as the biggest searchengine in the world. Google, more detailed the startpage with the searchbar. Ofcourse it will not have any function. Honestly im happy if it will look somewhat like the real one. IMOPRTANT! This is just training for my private use only I do not intend to montize or use any of Googles trademarks or code outside of my private, non-commerical, training. 

What I should learn in this project?
 -Be able to use rudimentaire html/css basis.
 -Read code of a developer Tool and use it.
 -Try to fix mistakes by myself
 -Learn how to use another websites image
 -In general from pure theoretical knowledge to a first and easy practical knowledge to really understand the learned.

   Sorry for the spelling mistakes :)
